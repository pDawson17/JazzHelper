# JazzHelper
## Overview
I created this Jazz Reference app in the summer of 2018 as a place to store useful improvisational techniques for
my own development as a jazz guitarist. I wanted to create an app that helped by providing tabs for many of the most common
modes and arpeggios for guitarists specifically, while also providing useful chord substitutions for the beginner to 
intermediate level jazz improviser. 
## Usage
This app is mostly a reference sheet for music theory. All that is required to use this app is to navigate to whatever page
you need information from, input your scale or chord, and generate the notes inside of it.
## File Structure
The back end of the application is done in React Context. Most of the scale creation is done on a provider stored in a 
folder named 'contexts'.
